# PythonApi Challenge

# Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

## Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.

### Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

### Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
To fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.

## Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.
